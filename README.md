# Tic Tac Toe

This project implements a classic Tic Tac Toe game in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players can choose between "Player vs Player" or "Player vs AI" modes using a dropdown menu. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid, where players take turns clicking cells to place their marks (X or O). The game checks for win conditions or draws and provides a status update on whose turn it is or if someone has won. Users can restart the game with a button. Styles are applied through a separate CSS file for a visually appealing interface.
